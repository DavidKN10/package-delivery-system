- Create the `Pack` and `SpecialPack` class
  - Make the special pack execption
- Create the `Truck` class
- Create the `Truck` child classes
- Work on the main file
  - Methods
    - pack sorting algorithm by date
    - function to find string nth occurrence (used for string parsing)
    - function to parse pack data
    - algorithm to assing packs
  - Main method
    - read input file
    - parse input data 
    - create packages
    - sort packs by day
    - create one small truck and use it for the `assignPacks()` algorithm
    - output trucks with packs on the output file
    - calculate and display truck hours on console
    - calculate and display number of each type of truck
