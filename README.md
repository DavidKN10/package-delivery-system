# Package Delivery System

This was a project that was assigned for a OOP class.
Now I use this project to teach myself programming
languages by building it in different languages.

Note that I did not check if the algorithm to assign packs to trucks actually worked. In class, it was only required to have an algorithm but never checked to see if it worked. 

## Languages so Far:
  - Java
  - Python
  - C++
  - C# (in progress)
